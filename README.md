Thanks to the mentor & creator of this project A.R.Shankar who I got inspired from and his course explaining the concepts very clearly  
And also for providing the Java files so the learners can concentrate on the CI/CD solely.

This is a concise README file format for GitHub outlining the process for creating a full-scale CI/CD application using the tools mentioned:

# Full-Scale CI/CD Application Guide

This guide outlines the process for creating a full-scale CI/CD application using tools such as Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes.

## 1. Jenkins Setup
- Installed Jenkins and configured plugins for source control, build, and deployment.
- Created and ran Jenkins jobs to pull code from GitHub, build Java projects using Maven, and deploy artifacts.

## 2. Docker Environment
- Installed Docker and created a Tomcat container using Dockerfiles.
- Integrated Docker with Jenkins for building and deploying applications.
- Automated build and deployment processes to Docker containers.

## 3. Ansible Integration
- Installed Ansible and used playbooks to manage Docker resources.
- Integrated Ansible with Jenkins to automate deployment tasks.
- Created Ansible playbooks for building images and managing Docker containers.

## 4. Continuous Deployment with Ansible
- Automated continuous deployment for Docker containers using Ansible playbooks.
- Configured Jenkins CI/CD jobs for deploying to Docker containers with Ansible.

## 5. Kubernetes Setup
- Installed and set up Kubernetes using Minikube, kubeadm, or a managed service (e.g., EKS).
- Familiarized with Kubernetes commands and created manifest files for resources.
- Managed Kubernetes resources using Ansible and Jenkins jobs.

## 6. Full CI/CD Pipeline
- Created Jenkins jobs for deploying to Kubernetes clusters.
- Enabled rolling updates for seamless deployment.
- Completed the CI/CD pipeline for building and deploying applications to Kubernetes.
